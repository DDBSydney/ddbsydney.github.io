Creative duo Nicolas Smith (Senior Art Director) and Damian Martinez (Senior Copywriter) are, as far as they know, the first Argentinian creatives to have crossed the Pacific to Australia. <br> <br> Together, they've won awards at major creative festivals across the world, including Cannes Lions, D&AD, Clio, London International Awards (LIA) and Effie, most notably for "Life Signs". DDB Sydney is their fourth agency together and their biggest move yet. <br> <br> "We're very excited to work alongside some of the best creatives in Australia and the world,” Nicolas said. <br> <br> "I'm loving this place. I even enjoy eating Vegemite,” Damian said. <br> <br> Canadian Art Director Alex Newman joins DDB with a swag of international awards under his belt, including Cannes Lions, The AToMiC Awards, The One Show, The New York Festival and London International Awards. In 2014 he was named ‘Top 30 Under 30’ by Marketing Magazine. <br> <br> Alex said he was drawn to DDB’s drive for world class creative and is looking forward to building projects that stretch the boundaries of what is considered ‘advertising’. <br> <br> “Ben (Welsh, CCO) has put together a powerful team, talent from all over the world, which has created this kind of hot bed of creativity. It’s an exciting time to be joining DDB,” Alex said. <br> <br> Sian Binder and Dave Govier join DDB as Creative Partners on McDonald’s. They have won a bunch of awards between them, including Cannes Lions, One Show, Clios and D&AD. <br> <br> Previously Head of Art at Ogilvy Sydney, Sian has worked on impressive award winning campaigns with talented creatives, while globe trotter Dave most recently freelanced at The Monkeys, Leo Burnett and Cummins & Partners after returning to Sydney from the legendary Saatchi’s London. <br> <br> Sian said she’s always admired DDB’s work. <br> <br> “I’m excited to join DDB on the Macca’s team. DDB and McDonald’s have a well-established partnership and I’m looking forward to working alongside such collaborative and passionate people. And the opportunity to work on one of Australia’s most loved brands made the decision to move to DDB an easy one,” Sian said. <br> <br> Dave’s highlights as Copywriter and Creative Director so far include winning the prestigious Carlsberg European Cup TVC for a small independent agency, helping the people of Ireland have another reason to drink alcohol in moderation by creating the outrageously successful Arthur’s Day annual celebration, along with Guinness’ very first global TVC which picked up a Cannes Lion. <br> <br> “Some things I look forward to doing more of include creating great film, digital, outdoor, print, events, promos, shelf-wobblers and any other ways we haven’t yet thought of to make famous work,” Dave said. <br> <br> DDB Sydney CCO Ben Welsh said he was excited to welcome these outstanding creatives to his team. <br> <br> “DDB Sydney is growing, in a very deliberate way,” Welsh said. <br> <br> “Our focus on diversity across the board, including getting more women into creative and management roles, continues to attract top class international and home grown talent, and means we continue to deliver stand out work for our clients,” Welsh said.</p> </div> </div> </section> <section class="section section--footer"> <footer class="footer"> <div class="footer__col footer__col--contact"> <p>Contact</p> <ul> <li> <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/aAmAd4ZJe5Q2" target="_blank" title="3/46-52 Mountain St, Ultimo NSW 2007, Sydney, Australia"> <span>3/46-52 Mountain St</span><br class="all"> <span>Ultimo NSW 2007</span><br class="all"> <span>Sydney, Australia</span> </a> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <a href="tel:0282602222" target="_blank" title="(02) 8260 2222"> <span>(02) 8260 2222</span> </a> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="footer__col footer__col--social"> <p>Social</p> <ul> <li> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ddbgroupsydney/" target="_blank" title="Instagram"> <span>Instagram</span> </a> </li> <li> <a href="https://twitter.com/ddbaustralia" target="_blank" title="Twitter"> <span>Twitter</span> </a> </li> <li> <a href="https://medium.com/ddb-sydney" target="_blank" title="Medium"> <span>Medium</span> </a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ddb-sydney" target="_blank" title="LinkedIn"> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="footer__col footer__col--empty"> <p class="footer__mob-copy footer__smaller-text">&copy; DDB Sydney 2017</p> </div> <div class="footer__col footer__col--ddb"> <p class="footer__des-copy">&copy; DDB Sydney 2017</p> </div> </footer> </section> </main> </body> <script type="text/javascript">
