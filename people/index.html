        <h1>Creativity + Humanity + Technology</h1>
        <p>As one of Australia’s largest and most diverse integrated communication agencies DDB Sydney helps clients transform their businesses by using an understanding of humanity, technology and creativity to change behaviour.</p>
        <p>We believe that in today’s cluttered multi media world, the battle to be heard is fiercer than ever.</p>
        <p>But as Bill Bernbach would say, people can’t listen to you if you haven’t got their attention and you can’t get their attention if you’re being ignored.</p>
        <p>At DDB Sydney we believe it’s never been more vital for ideas to be courageous and it’s never been more important to create ideas that inspire, influence and are <a href="#">impossible to ignore</a>.</p>

        <p>The most powerful element in advertising is the truth.<br>

        <h1>History – Doyle Dane Bernbach</h1>
        <p>The agency's first ads were for Ohrbach's department store and they typified the new "soft-sell" approach using catchy slogans and witty humour in contrast to the repetition and hard-sell advertising that was in vogue until then.</p>
        <p>The new agency was initially successful in winning business for clients with small budgets. As of 2013, DDB has had the Volkswagen account since 1959.</p>
        <p>Their campaigns for Volkswagen throughout the 1950s and 1960s were said to have revolutionized advertising. Notable campaigns included the 1959 Think Small series of Volkswagen advertisements, which was voted the No. 1 campaign of all time in Advertising Age’s 1999 The Century of Advertising.</p>
